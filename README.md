~~Working with Combine is great, but I'm not a big fan of having to assign a `Cancellable` to a variable just to keep it around.~~

When this was written, I was unaware of AnyCancellable's [`store(in:)` method](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/anycancellable/3333294-store). Which, makes this library pretty pointless! Don't use it!
